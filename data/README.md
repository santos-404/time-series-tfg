# Data

## Why is there no data?
I didn't upload every CSV to GitHub because I think it's unnecessary. The data is massive, and it can be downloaded locally using the attached scripts.

## Which data will be used?
These are all the variables I'll use. This might be modified across versions.

### Selected Variables:
