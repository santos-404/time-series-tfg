# TFG – Time Series Pattern Search

### Private Repository for TFG – Time Series Pattern Search with Evolutionary Algorithms & Machine Learning

This repository contains my Final Year Project (TFG) focused on pattern search in time series using evolutionary algorithms and machine learning techniques. The project explores advanced methods for identifying meaningful patterns in sequential data, optimizing search processes, and improving predictive capabilities.

Additionally, I developed a web application to visualize and interact with the results, providing an intuitive interface for analysis and experimentation.
